# Color Splash
A 2D mobile game made with unity aiming to teach kids (or adults) about color addition

## Main Idea
- One main idea of the gain is that the players need to pay attention to the change of background in order to play the game.   
- Background becames part of the game rather tahn just canvas for game objects.

## How to Play
- Tap left or right of the screen to control the motion of the character.  
- In easy mode, control the character to pick the blocks with same color as the background falling from above to earn points.  
Picking wrong color block leads to reduction in life.
- In difficult mode, control the character to pick blocks with same color as the background or blocks with color that add up to the color of the background before the background changes color.   
Double points are rewarded by picking color-add-up blocks.
- Pick heart shapes to get extra lifes.
